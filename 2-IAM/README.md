### Identity and Access Managment

- IAM policies can be attached at different levels: groups, users (inline policies), and multiple groups.

- Users inherit policies from all groups they belong to, combining permissions.

- IAM policy structure includes version, ID, and statements with key elements: Sid, Effect, Principal, Action,Resource, and optional Condition.

- Understanding Effect, Principal, Action, and Resource is essential for managing AWS permissions effectively.
